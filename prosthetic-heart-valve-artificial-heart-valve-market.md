<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prosthetic Heart Valve/ Artificial Heart Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valve</li><li>Tissue Heart Valve</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prosthetic heart valve market consists of three main types: transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive options, delivered through a catheter, suited for patients at high surgical risk. Tissue heart valves, made from biological materials, offer biocompatibility and reduced thrombogenicity but may have limited longevity. Mechanical heart valves, constructed from durable materials, provide long-term durability but necessitate lifelong anticoagulation therapy. Each type caters to specific patient needs and clinical conditions.</p></p>
